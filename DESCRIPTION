Title: Programming with Big Data --- Interface to PAPI
Version: 0.3-3
Description: A collection of tools for measuring performance counter
    data.  On modern 'x86' hardware, as programs are running, 
    certain performance side-effects are being measured, like
    cache misses, number of floating point operations executed, 
    etc.  This package allows the R user to easily collect this counter 
    data for their R programs.  The package uses the well-known 
    C library 'PAPI' to perform the counter lookups.  There is also
    an experimental interface to the Intel Performance Counter Monitor
    (IPCM) for Windows and Mac users.
